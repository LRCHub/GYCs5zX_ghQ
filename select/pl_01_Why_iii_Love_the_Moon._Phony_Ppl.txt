Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think
you've found it
The illusions in your eyes
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's
there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about
what it seems to be
You think the Earth
is where you stand
You're in the palm of
someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every night up out my window
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every single night
I look outside
It's right there for me
And my mind
And that's why
I love the moon, yeah
Because people can
consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think
you've found it
The illusions in your eyes,
it blinds
So be careful where
you look for love, ohh
Just be careful
where you look for love, ohh
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think
you've found it
The illusions in your eyes,
it blinds us all
So be careful where you
look for love-ove
Just be careful
where you look for love, ohh
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, that's why
I let the moon shine
('Cause through the time
I've been confused on
how to move on)
I'm stuck in between
what wasn't and what
could be the truth, ha
(Still up tryna escape
the demons in my room, yo)
You see it's no
change droppin'
we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody
else feel pain when
they brainwash us?
And watch us every
time we make exchanges
(We slaves)
Locked in a box,
we use our mind just to escape
all the same shit
I'm tired of the pain
Love is blind to the flame
That's why I look up,
never hide behind sky's
when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin'
through denyin' the pain
That's why I look
for ways find whatever
lies in the rain
'Cause shit change
I don't blame my father
for lampin' I believe
that helped
Went from tryna grow as
your son to tryna grow
as myself
So understand it when
I'm stranded, takin' chances
Know I need that fall
Flat on my back,
you just relax and
kick your seat back, uh
'Cause when you think
That's when you let
time run and escape
what your mind loving
That's what you think
So what you think?
If love was easy to find,
we wouldn't need it to
complete our lives
So
Peace to the moon
Peace to the stars
Peace to Saturn
And peace to Mars
